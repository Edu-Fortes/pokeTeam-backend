# pokeTeam

## Back-End

This repository is for the Back-End side of the TripleTen WebDev bootcamp final project. It will work in conjunction with the pokeTeam [Front-End repository](https://github.com/Edu-Fortes/pokeTeam-frontend)

The intention is to build a server who will provide authentication and data base capability to the users of PokeTeam App. It will:

- Store a user registration
- Autenthicate the user
- Store the "captured" pokemons that the user chose to form a team
